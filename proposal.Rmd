# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data scientist consultancy firm

**Target audience**: Global cosmetic marketing and consulting companies

Makeup foundation usually comes in many different shades, contributed by factors such as hue, saturation, brightness, and lightness levels. Each beauty brand also has its own distribution of makeup foundation products that have the different shades to meet customer demands. If we could understand which beauty brands and their foundation products that meet the specific shades requirements, it could be helpful for cosmetic marketing and consulting companies to make informed decisions. 

To address this objective, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that allows our target audience to visually and interactively explore a dataset of makeup foundation shades by different global beauty products from different brands. Our dashboard will show the distribution of foundation products by shades and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and re-ordering on different variables such as brands, hue, and saturation in order to compare factors that contribute to different foundation shades.

# Section 2: Description of the [data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/makeup-shades)

We will be visualizing a dataset of 625 observations. Each observation has 8 associated relevant variables that describe a particular foundation `product` from a particular `brand` with a particular shade (represented as `hex` which stands for *hexadecimal color code* in the dataset), which has associated hue `H`, saturation `S`, brightness `V`, and lightness `L` numerical values, and has associated product `group` (of 7 categories - *0: Fenty Beauty's PRO FILT'R Foundation Only*; *1: Make Up For Ever's Ultra HD Foundation Only*; *2: US Best Sellers*; *3: BIPOC-recommended Brands with BIPOC Founders*; *4: BIPOC-recommended Brands with White Founders*; *5: Nigerian Best Sellers*; *6: Japanese Best Sellers*; *7: Indian Best Sellers*).    

# Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Our project answers the broad research question of: "What is the range and distribution of makeup foundations shades offered by each of the best-selling cosmetics brands across the globe". Our broad research question can be further split into the 3 sub-questions specified below: 

- RQ1. What shades do best-selling foundation products of each country offer?   
- RQ2. What brands are part of the best-selling foundation products in each country?
- RQ3. What is the distribution of foundation shades offered by the best-selling brands in each country?

Below we have provided a usage scenario of our product by a member of our intended target audience:

Beth is a consultant at a well-known global cosmetics marketing and consulting company.  As part of her job, Beth advises large cosmetics companies on new product launches and strategies needed for entering new international markets. 

Beth is working closely with a client who is planning the launch of a makeup foundation product across the globe. Beth needs to understand her client’s competitors across the globe. She also needs to understand what shades of foundation products her client’s competitors are offering as well as the distribution of shades they are offering in each of the global markets. This would allow Beth to advise her clients to design a shade range that meets the needs of each of the markets they are entering and to stock their products for each market appropriately. 

When Beth uses the “Foundation Shades Across the Globe App”, she will see the specific shades of global best-selling foundations and their distribution on a lightness scale. Beth will be able to filter this dataset by specific regions (e.g. US, Japan or Nigeria), or by specific brands (e.g. L’Oreal or Maybelline) to view the shades of foundation offered. She will further be able to see what brands are offered in each of the regions to see who her client’s competitors are in each market. Finally, she is able to view the distribution of shades on a lightness scale for each region, to see if her clients need to focus on a particular region of the shade spectrum when entering a specific market. 

With the insight gained from this app, Beth advises her clients to offer a wide range of shades in the US market as all her client’s competitors are offering 20+ shades in the US market. She also notices a market entry opportunity in India as most  of her client’s competitors in India offer a limited shade range that is skewed towards lighter tones. She advises her clients to offer an expanded shade range in India and launch a culturally-sensitive yet progressive marketing campaign on embracing your natural skin tone by wearing an appropriately matched foundation shade. Her clients are impressed by her data-driven insights.
