# Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

**Our role**: Data scientist consultancy firm

**Target audience**: Global cosmetic marketing and consulting companies

Makeup foundation usually comes in many different shades, contributed by factors such as hue, saturation, brightness, and lightness levels. Each beauty brand also has its own distribution of makeup foundation products that have the different shades to meet customer demands. If we could understand which beauty brands and their foundation products that meet the specific shades requirements, it could be helpful for cosmetic marketing and consulting companies to make informed decisions. 

To address this objective, we propose building a data visualization dashboard that allows our target audience to visually and interactively explore a dataset of makeup foundation shades by different global beauty products from different brands. Our dashboard will show the distribution of foundation products by shades and allow users to explore different aspects of this data by filtering and re-ordering on different variables such as brands, hue, and saturation in order to compare factors that contribute to different foundation shades.

# Section 2: Description of the [data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/makeup-shades)

We will be visualizing a dataset of 625 observations. Each observation has 8 associated relevant variables that describe a particular foundation `product` from a particular `brand` with a particular shade (represented as `hex` which stands for *hexadecimal color code* in the dataset), which has associated hue `H`, saturation `S`, brightness `V`, and lightness `L` numerical values, and has associated product `group` (of 7 categories - *0: Fenty Beauty's PRO FILT'R Foundation Only*; *1: Make Up For Ever's Ultra HD Foundation Only*; *2: US Best Sellers*; *3: BIPOC-recommended Brands with BIPOC Founders*; *4: BIPOC-recommended Brands with White Founders*; *5: Nigerian Best Sellers*; *6: Japanese Best Sellers*; *7: Indian Best Sellers*).
