# Foundation Shades Across the Globe App

-   author: Ela Bandari, Ling (Elina) Lin, Kangbo Lu, Rachel Xu

## Description of the app
This interactive app consists of visualization charts (histograms and color cards) that display the shades (based on lightness) in global best-selling foundation products of different beauty brands around the world. The filters on the top allow users to compare shade distributions by countries and by brands offered in a particular country. On the chart, users can select a category under the chart legend to focus on only one shade distribution, or zoom in on the distributions to closely examine a particular range of shades. There are also customizable sliders for users to specify ranges of variables (brightness, hue and saturation)  and the app will return similar shades available in the market. The distributions and search results will be updated automatically when changing the filters or sliders.
